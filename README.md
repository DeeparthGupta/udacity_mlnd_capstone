The dataset can be downloaded from https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/

The 3rd notebook uses Google colab. There is a link included in the notebook. Some of the file paths will not work because they correspond to the directory in my google drive. All the data can be generated though so that should not be a problem for someone willing to edit the file paths.

The libraries used are included in the requirements.txt
